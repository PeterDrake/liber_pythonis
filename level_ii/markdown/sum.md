# `sum`

The built-in `sum` functions returns the sum of a list of values.

`sum([1, 2, 3])` returns `6`.

## Explorations

1. For each expression below, predict what will happen when you type it into the interactive console, then test your
   prediction. Summarize what you learn in your notes.
   ```python
   sum([])
   ```
   ```python
   sum([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
   ```
   ```python
   sum(1, 2, 3, 4)
   ```
   ```python
   sum(['1', '2', '3'])
   ```
      ```python
   sum('123')
   ```
1. `sum` takes an optional second argument. By experimenting with the expressions below, figure out what this second
   argument does. Summarize what you learn in your notes.
   ```python
   sum([1, 2, 3], 10)
   ```
   ```python
   sum([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [])
   ```
   ```python
   sum(['do', 're', 'mi'], '')
   ```
