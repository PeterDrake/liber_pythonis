# Liber Pythonis

## Motivation

This book introduces Python programming, basic statistics, and data visualization. It is written for an audience of
first-year undergraduate students with no previous programming experience. Specifically, it is used in the *Measuring
Up* sections of Lewis & Clark College's first-year quantitative seminar Numbers, taught by Peter Drake and Liz Stanhope.

More advanced readers will know that there are more concise, efficient, or Pythonic ways to do things. We have placed
more emphasis on using a minimal set of tools to make the material more accessible.
