# Liber Pythonis

## Motivation

This book introduces Python programming, basic statistics, and data visualization. It is written for an audience of
first-year undergraduate students with no previous programming experience. Specifically, it is used in the *Measuring
Up* sections of Lewis & Clark College's first-year quantitative seminar Numbers, taught by Peter Drake and Liz Stanhope.

More advanced readers will know that there are more concise, efficient, or Pythonic ways to do things. We have placed
more emphasis on using a minimal set of tools to make the material more accessible.

### Level II: Measures of Central Tendency

* [The `len` Function](level_ii/markdown/len.md)

* Sort Strings by Length (introducing `key=` for `sorted`)
* List Index
* Equality Test `==`* `if`
* Integer Division `//` `%`
* The Median (Middle Value) of a List of Numbers
* `count`
* `max` (since we have sort, we could define this ourselves as an exploration!)
* The Mode (Most Common Value) of a List of Numbers
* Quests
    * Proportion
    * Explore Mean, Median, and Mode in Histogram

### Level III: Measures of Spread

* Frequency Bar Chart
* Lore
    * Measures of Spread
    * Reading Box Plots

### Level IV: Distributions

* Proportion
* `random`
    * `sample`
* Lore
    * Populations and Samples
    * Parameters and Statistics
    * Central Limit Theorem for Proportions
    * Confidence Interval

### Level VI: Relationships Between Variables
