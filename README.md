# Motivation

This repository introduces Python programming as magical spellcasting, as represented in fantasy literature, films, and games. It is written for an audience of first-year undergraduate students with no previous programming experience. Specifically, it is used in the *Measuring Up* sections of Lewis & Clark College's first-year quantiative seminar Numbers, taught by Peter Drake and Liz Stanhope. Students are expected to emerge from the course with the ability to use Python for data visualization and simple statistical analysis.

More advanced readers will know that there are more concise, efficient, or Pythonic ways to do things. We have placed more emphasis on introducing a minimal set of tools so as not to overwhelm our students.
