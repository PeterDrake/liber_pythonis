# The List Data Type

In addition to processing individual numbers, Python can work with ***lists***. A list is written in square brackets,
with the individual values separated by commas:

```python
[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
```

Lists can also be stored in variables.

## Explorations

1. For each expression below, predict what will happen when you type it into the interactive console, then test your
   prediction. Summarize what you learn in your notes.
   ```python
   [1*2, 2*3, 3*4]
   ```
   ```python
   []   
   ```
   ```python
   [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]
   ```
   ```python
   [1, 2] + [3, 4]
   ```
   ```python
   [1, 2] + 3
   ```
   ```python
   [1, 2] + [3]
   ```
   ```python
   [1, 2] * 3
   ```
   ```python
   [1, 2]]
   ```
1. If you type `[1, 2` into the interactive console what do you think will happen? Now try it. If you get into this
   situation, you can get out by typing `]`. Sometimes it is necessary to do so several times.
