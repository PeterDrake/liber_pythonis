# Writing a Python Program

Sometimes you want to enter several lines of Python code. The interactive console is fine, but if you find yourself
using the same code on multiple occasions, you don't want to have to type everything each time. Instead, you can
save the lines in a Python ***program***, which is a file whose name ends in `.py`.

As a simple example, you might put a bunch of variable definitions in a program:

```python
length = 1
width = 4
height = 9
```

You could then run the program and do things with these variables in the interactive console.
