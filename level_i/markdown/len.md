# Scroll: Len

## Incantation

```python
length = len('abracadabra')
print(length)
```

## Effect

```
11
```

## Explanation

This is the same effect as the spell [Find Length of String](../code/find_length_of_string.py), but is much more
concise. This effect is needed so often that it's worth knowing how to use the `len` scroll.
