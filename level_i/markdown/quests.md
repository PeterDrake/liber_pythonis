1. Use a spell to find the length of your full name (including any spaces or other punctuation marks).

1. Find the first full sentence in the physical book nearest you right now. Use a spell to determine the number of
words in that sentence. Hint: count the spaces.

1. Print the first ten whole numbers counting *down*, as in a rocket launch.

1. Create a spell to center a string so that the result is 10 characters wide. You may assume that the original string
is no longer than this. Hint: `n // 2` gives you half of `n`, throwing away any fraction.
