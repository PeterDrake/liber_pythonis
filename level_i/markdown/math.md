# The `math` Library

Python has a vast number of ***libraries*** of useful functions. One of these is the `math` library.

To use the `math` library, include this line at the beginning of your program:

```python
import math
```

Now you can call various functions from the library. For example, the `sqrt` function returns the square root of a
number.

```python
x = math.sqrt(25)
```

Other useful functions include `log`, and the trigonometric functions `sin`, `cos`, `tan`.

The `math` library also provides a few useful constants like `math.pi`.

## Explorations

1. Try the following Parsons puzzle, which gives you the code but asks you to arrange it in the correct order. This should be more relaxing than starting from a blank page. After you've arranged the pieces, click on the "Get feedback" button to see how you did; if everything turns green, you've solved the puzzle. Try as many times as you like!

1. Can you use `math` functions in the interactive console?

1. Look up the [documentation for the `math` library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html). What is `math.inf`?
