# The String Data Type

Another data type, in addition to numbers and lists, is the text ***string***:

```python
'Hello!'
```

A list is a sequence of values of any type, but a string is specifically a sequence of characters.

## Explorations

1. For each expression below, predict what will happen when you type it into the interactive console, then test your
   prediction. Summarize what you learn in your notes.
   ```python
   "wizard"
   ```
   ```python
   "I can't believe it's text"
   ```   
   ```python
   'The "forbidden" fruit'
   ```
   ```python
   'The neverending
   ```
   ```python
   'isn't'
   ```
   ```python
   "isn't"
   ```
   ```python
   'I \'want\' "both" kinds'
   ```
   ```python
   'hot' + 'dog'
   ```
   ```python
   23 + ' skidoo'
   ```
   ```python
   str(23) + ' skidoo'
   ```
   ```python
   'na' * 16 + ' Batman!'
   ```
1. Try the following Parsons puzzle, which gives you the code but asks you to arrange it in the correct order. This should be more relaxing than starting from a blank page. After you've arranged the pieces, click on the "Get feedback" button to see how you did. Try as many times as you like!
