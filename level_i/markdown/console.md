# The Interactive Console

The interactive console is where you can enter an individual line of Python code and see what happens. The
console shows a prompt, something like this:

```
>
```

The exact appearance of the prompt may vary depending on your system.

At the prompt, type a Python expression, like

```python
2 + 2
```

and hit `enter`. Python then reads in your expression, evaluates it, and prints the result:

```python
4
```

Soon we'll talk about putting many lines of code into a program file so that you can save them to reuse later.

There are two reasons to know about the interactive console:

* You can get a surprising amount done in one line of Python.
* When exploring or debugging, it's useful to be able to quickly ask Python, "What would happen if I did *this*?"
