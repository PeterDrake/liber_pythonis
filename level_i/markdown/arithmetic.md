# Arithmetic Operators

The interactive console can be used as a calculator. You can combine numbers with the following
arithmetic ***operators***:

| Operator | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `+` | Addition |
| `-` | Subtraction (or negation) |
| `*` | Multiplication |
| `/` | Division |
| `**` | Exponentiation |

For example, `2 ** 3` is Python for ![2 to the 3rd power](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?2^3), which evaluates to
`8`.

You can also use parentheses in the way you're used to from math classes.

## Explorations

1. For each of the Python expressions below, first *predict* what its value is, then type it into the interactive console
   to check.

    The prediction step is very important! If the results matches your prediction, you gain confidence in your mental model
    of how Python works. If it doesn't, your mental model may shift to accommodate this new evidence; research shows that
    this is much more effective than just reading the answer. If it doesn't match and you don't understand why, ask a
    classmate, teaching assistant, or instructor.

    ```python
    8 / 3
    ```
    
    ```python
    2 - (9 / 3)
    ```
    
    ```python
    4+1 * 5
    ```
    
    ```python
    3.14159 * -2
    ```
    
    ```python
    1 / 0
    ```
    
    To solidify your learning, write in your notes the rules for arithmetic in Python. How does Python decide in
    which order to perform operations? Under what circumstances does the answer include a decimal point?

1. What's the shortest expression you can write that produces a number at least 100 digits long?
