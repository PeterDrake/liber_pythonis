# Observational Units and Variables: Statistics Start Here

In statistics we study the characteristics of some sort of object.  Statisticians call the objects that we study ***units*** or ***observational units***.  The characteristics of the objects that we study are called ***variables***.

## Examples 
- A teacher asks each student in a class what their favorite ice cream flavor is.  The ***observational unit*** is a student in the class, and the ***variable*** is the student's favorite ice cream flavor.
- A pediatrician measures the weights of all of their patients.  The ***observational unit*** is the patient, and the ***variable*** is their weight.

Variables are classified into different types.  We'll focus on two types of variables in this class:  
- A variable like ice cream flavor is called a ***categorical variable***.  Categorical variables take on values from a list of possible categories, like chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, etc.  
- A variable like weight is called a ***quantitative variable***.  Quantitative variables take on numerical values.

Helpful Tool:  If it makes sense to compute the average of a variable, then that variable is quantitative.  Also, quantitative variables have units.

## Examples
- The average favorite ice cream flavor of students in a class doesn't makes sense. This indicates ice cream flavor is a categorical variable. 
- It makes sense to talk about the average weight of a group of children.  This indicates weight is a quantitative variable.  Another indication is that weight is measured with units such as pounds or kilograms.
