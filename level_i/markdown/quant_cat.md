In statistics we study the characteristics of some sort of object.  Statisticians call the objects that we study units or observational units.  The characteristics of those objects that we study are called variables.Examples: A teacher asks each student in their class what their favorite color is.  The observational unit is a student in the class, and the variable is the student's favorite color.A pediatrician measures the weights of all of their patients.  The observational unit is the patient, and the variable is their weight.Variables are classified into different types.  We'll focus on two types of variables in this class:  A variable like color is categorical.  It takes on values from a list of possible categories, like blue, green, red, etc.  A variable like weight is quantitative.  It takes on numerical values.Helpful Tool:  If it makes sense to compute the average of a variable, then that variable is quantitative.  Also, quantitative variables have units.Examples:It makes sense to talk about the average weight of a group of children.  This indicates weight is a quantitative variable.  Another indication is that weight is measured with units such as pounds or kilograms.The average favorite color of students in a class doesn't makes sense. This indicates color is a categorical variable.
