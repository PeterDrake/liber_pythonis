# Defining a Variable

Typing in numbers can be tedious and error-prone, so Python allows you to define ***variables***:

```python
x = 3
```

Here, you've given the variable `x` the value `3`. If you were to now type `x` into the interactive console, you would
get back `3`.

## Explorations

1. Predict the result of entering each of the following lines (or sequences of lines) into the interactive console,
   then try them. When you're done, summarize what you have learned in your notes.
   
   ```python
   age = 18
   age + 3
   ```

   ```python
   f = 212
   (f - 32) * 5/9
   ```
      
   ```python
   ultimate_answer = 42
   ultimate_answer
   ```
   
   ```python
   SCREAM = 1
   SCREAM = 2
   SCREAM
   ```
   
   ```python
   d = 23
   D = 17
   d
   ```
   
   ```python
   10 = n
   ```
   
   ```python
   x = 1
   y = x
   y
   ```
   
   ```python
   x = 1
   y = x
   x = 2
   y
   ```
