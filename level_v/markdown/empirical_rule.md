# More About Normal Distributions

Normal distributions are modeled by bell-shaped curves called ***normal curves***.  If your data is normally distributed with mean &mu; and standard deviation &sigma;, there is a specific normal curve that models your data.  In symbols, the corresponding normal curve is:

</blockquote>

As seen in the figure below, different choices of mean &mu; and standard deviation &sigma; give normal curves with different shapes.  However both of these curves are still normal curves.
