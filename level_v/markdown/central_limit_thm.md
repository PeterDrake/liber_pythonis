# The Central Limit Theorem

## The key ideas of this theorem (in words)
* We have seen that as you take more and more samples, the distribution of sample proportions becomes closer and closer to a normal distribution.
* Also, if the parameter proportion for the entire populatin is P, the distribution of sample proportions has mean close to P.
* Finally, if we increase the size of the sample, the spread of the distribution of sample proportions decreases.

## The formal statement of the Central Limit Theorem

Suppose many simple random samples of size n are drawn from a population.  For each sample, a sample proportion p^ is recorded.  Let P denote the parameter proportion describing the whole population.  If nP and n(1-P) are both greater than 10, then the sampling distribution of all possible sample proportions p^ is:
* normal
* centered at P (so its mean is P)
* has standard deviation given by the following expression
