# What is a Sampling Distribution?

Before stating what a sampling distribution actually is, let's look at an example of an *almost* sampling distribution.

## Example of an *almost* sampling distribution

Suppose we would like to know what proportion of adults in the U.S. are definitely planning to get vaccinated against COVID, or have already been vaccinated.  So our population of interest is the roughly 250 million adults in the U.S.  By some miracle we collect ten perfect simple random samples of this population, each with 1000 voters, and record the proportion of adults in each sample that have been or will get the vaccine against COVID.  

Here are the results of the survey, which are completely made up:

| sample | # yes to vaccine | p^ = proportion saying yes to vaccine |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1      | 555              | 0.555                                 |
| 2      | 492              | 0.492                                 |
| 3      | 570              | 0.570                                 |
| 4      | 399              | 0.399                                 |
| 5      | 622              | 0.622                                 |
| 6      | 501              | 0.501                                 |
| 7      | 412              | 0.412                                 |
| 8      | 380              | 0.380                                 |
| 9      | 524              | 0.524                                 |
| 10     | 475              | 0.475                                 |

We then make a dot plot of the proportions associated to each sample.  This plot is given below.  A single dot in this dot plot represents the proportion of people in one of the ten samples that responded they would definitely get or have already gotten a COVID vaccine.  For example, the dot highlighted in green represents the 0.412 in the proportion column of the table above.  Since each dot in the dot plot records a *sample proportion* we call this plot an (almost) *sampling distribution*.  (For why *almost* is included, just keep reading.
