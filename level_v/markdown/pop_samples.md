# Samples and Populations

An important application of statistics is to use a sample to understand some feature of a larger population.  This process is called ***statistical inference***.  It takes a few layers of theory to be able to do statistical inference.  The first step is to understand how the words ***populations***, ***parameters***, ***samples***, and ***statistics*** are used in statistics.  That is the focus of this page.
